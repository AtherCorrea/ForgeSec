# ðŸ“š Ather SOC Homelab â€“ Documentation

This directory contains all structured documentation for the Ather SOC Homelab project. Each folder and document serves as a real, version-controlled knowledge base focused on learning, implementation, and analysis.

> Unlike superficial documentation or temporary notes, this project emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and professional technical writing.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

| Folder        | Purpose                                                        |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `learning/`   | In-depth technical studies and theory (e.g. IDS/IPS architecture) |
| `roadmap.md`  | Overall learning and implementation plan for the homelab       |
| `topology.md` | Network layout and lab design                                  |

Each component used in the lab (firewall, SIEM, IDS/IPS) has dedicated subfolders, tests, and notes spread across `lab/`, `docs/`, and configuration directories.
