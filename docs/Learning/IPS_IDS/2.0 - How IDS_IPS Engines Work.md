# 2.0 - How IDS/IPS Engines Work

This document describes the internal architecture of Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), focusing on how packets are processed before a detection rule is evaluated. Understanding this flow is critical for mastering rule behavior, performance tuning, and accurate alert analysis.

> This section prepares the ground for deeper analysis in the next chapters, which will cover how rules are evaluated and alerts are generated.

## 2.1 Packet Capture and Ingestion

- Supported interfaces: `libpcap`, `AF_PACKET`, `Netmap`, `DPDK`
- Modes of operation: passive (SPAN/mirror) or inline (bridge)
- Optional BPF filters to reduce noise at the NIC level
- Supports VLANs, interface bonding, and multi-NIC environments

## 2.2 Decoding and Normalization

- Parses Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, and application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TLS)
- Performs reassembly of fragmented IP packets and TCP streams
- Normalizes ambiguous or malformed traffic
- Helps prevent evasion techniques that rely on broken packet structures

## 2.3 Flow and Session Tracking

- Tracks connections based on 5-tuple (src IP, dst IP, src port, dst port, protocol)
- Reconstructs bidirectional flows (sessions)
- Maintains protocol state (TCP handshake, session timeout, etc.)
- Enables context-aware detection across multi-packet conversations

## 2.4 Preprocessing and Metadata Enrichment

- Identifies application protocols (e.g., TLS, HTTP)
- Extracts useful fields for rule matching (e.g., HTTP method, SNI, URI)
- Adds internal metadata (e.g., `flow_id`, `app_proto`, `tls.version`)
- Enables deeper inspection based on enriched context

## 2.5 Multithreading and Performance Model

- Threading modes: `autofp`, `workers`, `pcap`, etc.
- Packet streams are processed in parallel using multiple threads
- Tunable options: `detect-thread-ratio`, buffer sizes, timeouts
- CPU affinity and core pinning improve performance and determinism

## 2.6 Logging and Output

- Main formats:
  - `eve.json`: structured JSON logs (for SIEM integration)
  - `fast.log`: minimal flat text alerts
  - `stats.log`: performance metrics
- Common fields: timestamp, SID, flow ID, source/destination IPs, protocol, metadata
- Outputs are consumed by dashboards, SIEMs, and correlation engines
