# 🧠 IDS/IPS Mastery Path

This document outlines a structured learning journey to deeply understand Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), using hands-on experiments, log analysis, and real-world tools like Suricata and pfSense.

> The goal is not simply to *use* IDS/IPS tools — but to fully understand **how** they work, **why** they matter, and **what happens internally** when malicious traffic is detected or blocked. This is part of a broader initiative to master cybersecurity through real lab work.

## 📚 Learning Stages

### 1. 🔍 Fundamentals (Theory)

Understand the foundational concepts:

- What are IDS and IPS?
- IDS vs IPS vs Firewalls – core differences
- Inline vs Passive deployment
- Detection techniques: Signature-based vs Anomaly-based

📄 Documentation: [`2.0 - IPS-IDS Fundamentals – Theoretical Concepts.md`](./2.0 - IPS_IDS Fundamentals – Theoretical Concepts.md)

---

### 2. 🧠 How IDS/IPS Engines Work

Understand the internal architecture of IDS/IPS solutions:

- Traffic capture and preprocessing stages
- Flow/session tracking and inspection
- How detection pipelines evaluate packets
- Multithreading, performance tuning, and log outputs
- Differences in passive (IDS) vs inline (IPS) modes

📄 Documentation: [`2.1 - How IDS/IPS Engines Work`](./2.1 - How IDS_IPS Engines Work.md)

---

### 3. 🧾 Rule Behavior & Signature Analysis

Explore how rules actually work:

- Rule structure: `msg`, `sid`, `classtype`, `priority`, etc.
- Rule matching engine and order of evaluation
- Custom rule creation and testing
- How Suricata prioritizes alerts
- Identifying and tuning false positives

📄 Coming soon: `rules_analysis.md` under `ids/suricata/docs`

---

### 4. 🧪 Detection Testing in Lab

Simulate real attacks and verify detection:

- Attack simulations (Nmap scans, Metasploit payloads, brute force, etc.)
- Triggering IDS alerts with known test signatures
- Analyzing results in Suricata logs
- Cleaning logs between tests for reproducibility

📄 First test case: [`test-01_nmap-scan`](../../ids/suricata/tests/test-01_nmap-scan)

---

### 5. 📊 SIEM Integration (Post IDS)

Expand visibility by forwarding Suricata data:

- Shipping Suricata logs to SIEM (Wazuh/Splunk)
- Parsing and enrichment for correlation
- Combining IDS with firewall and endpoint telemetry
- Visualizing timeline, severity, and frequency

📄 To be documented under: `siem/` once implementation begins

---

### 6. 🧬 Advanced Topics & Optimization

Refine and expand your IDS/IPS knowledge:

- Performance tuning and hardware optimization
- Detection evasion techniques and countermeasures
- Threat Intelligence integration with Suricata
- Automated rule management (PulledPork, Oinkmaster)
- IPS mode configuration and packet drop verification

📄 Will be tracked in `ids/suricata/docs/advanced.md`
