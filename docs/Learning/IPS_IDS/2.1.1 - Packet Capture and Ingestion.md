# 📥 2.1.1 – Packet Capture and Ingestion (Explained)

This is the first stage of the IDS/IPS engine pipeline — where raw traffic is acquired from the network interfaces before decoding or analysis.

---

## 🔹 What are Raw Packets?

**Raw packets** refer to network frames or datagrams captured directly from the network interface — before any processing by the operating system. This includes the **Ethernet frame**, **IP headers**, **TCP/UDP headers**, and the **payload**.

These packets represent exactly what is seen on the wire, byte-for-byte.

🔎 Example:  
A TCP SYN packet from an Nmap scan would be captured in its entirety, including flags, options, and payload if present.

📘 RFC Reference: [RFC 791 – Internet Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc791)

## 🔹 Capture Interfaces Used by IDS Engines

IDS/IPS systems like Suricata support several methods for packet capture. Each has different performance characteristics and system requirements.

---

### 📘 libpcap

- Most common and portable capture method  
- Used by tools like `tcpdump`, `Wireshark`, and Suricata (`pcap` mode)  
- Operates in **user space**, pulling packets from kernel buffers  
- Uses **BPF filters** to filter incoming traffic

### 🔧 AF_PACKET (Linux-specific)

- High-performance Linux socket for raw packet capture  
- Works in **kernel space**, then delivers to user space  
- Allows use of **ring buffers** for efficient capture (zero-copy with `TPACKET_V3`)  
- Preferred for high-speed environments in Linux

---

### ⚙️ Netmap

- Framework for **fast packet I/O** between NIC and user space  
- Bypasses Linux network stack entirely  
- Uses **zero-copy** and direct memory access (DMA)  
- Excellent for IDS/IPS at 10Gbps+ links

### 🚀 DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit)

- Set of libraries for **ultra-fast packet processing** in user space  
- Requires compatible NICs and CPU features (e.g., hugepages, UIO)  
- Can handle **40Gbps+ throughput**  
- Often used in **telco** and **high-frequency trading** environments

## 🧪 Passive vs Inline Modes

| Mode      | Description                              | Use Case                              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Passive** | Uses mirror port or tap; non-intrusive   | Safe observation, SOC-style monitoring |
| **Inline**  | IDS sits in the traffic path; can block  | Real-time protection, active prevention|

> In passive mode, packets are duplicated and sent to the IDS — the IDS cannot alter them. In inline mode, the IDS/IPS acts like a transparent bridge and can **drop, modify or allow** traffic.

---

## 🎯 BPF Filters (Berkeley Packet Filters)

Used to **selectively capture** only specific traffic based on rules like IP, port, protocol, etc.

Example:  
`tcpdump -i eth0 tcp port 80`

- Great for reducing resource usage  
- Used by `libpcap`, `tcpdump`, and Suricata in `pcap` mode

## 🌐 Interface Bonding and VLAN Support

- **Bonding** allows multiple NICs to act as a single interface (for redundancy or performance)  
- **VLAN support** enables the IDS to inspect tagged traffic across virtual LANs  
- Important for setups with mirrored trunks or SPAN ports

## 📦 Summary

Understanding how raw packet ingestion works is essential to:

- Optimize packet capture for performance  
- Choose the right capture method for your network  
- Troubleshoot packet loss or missed alerts  
- Improve IDS visibility and accuracy
