# 🧬 ForgeSec — Cybersecurity Engineering Platform

**ForgeSec** is a modular cybersecurity engineering platform designed to simulate, study, and evolve the architecture of modern defensive systems — from theory to practical validation.

This is not a repository of tools or tutorials. It's a long-term, high-fidelity technical portfolio that documents how real security engineering works — across simulation, detection, infrastructure, adversarial testing, and eventually automation and AI.

> 🧠 ForgeSec is a living ecosystem of cybersecurity projects — each one independently designed, deeply documented, and purpose-built to reflect the complexity of modern defense.  
> It's my way of learning by building, documenting by understanding, and sharing every step with engineering clarity.

## 🌐 What Is ForgeSec?

ForgeSec is structured as a growing collection of technical projects — each exploring a critical dimension of cybersecurity engineering. While most projects are connected, each has its own scope, roadmap, and documentation.

Currently, the platform contains:

- **Cyber Core** — a hands-on, modular simulation environment built to reflect how real-world defensive architecture behaves under real conditions.  
It’s where theory meets practice: every detection engine, protocol, signature, and adversarial input is tested in a controlled yet realistic setup. Cyber Core includes segmented networks, firewalls, IDS/IPS, virtual machines, and an expanding set of SIEM and logging integrations — but more than that, it’s a space to simulate what real engineers do: test, break, observe, and rebuild defensive strategy.
More than a lab — it's a framework to understand how secure environments are designed, evaluated, and evolved.
- **IGNITE** — a custom-built offensive engineering engine in active development.  
Its mission is to simulate real-world attacks, automate adversarial behavior, and generate test traffic that challenges detection systems under pressure. From simple scans to evasive payloads, IGNITE will serve as a programmable attacker designed to probe, validate, and break assumptions in Cyber Core.
The final goal is to make IGNITE a companion tool for advanced detection testing — with protocol-level control, replay capabilities, and integration with ForgeSec’s learning workflows.

- **Learning Modules** — structured deep-dives into IDS/IPS internals, protocol behavior, evasion, flow tracking, and detection theory. Each topic is tied to lab-based validation.

These modules are independently versioned and can evolve without breaking the larger vision. Future projects will expand ForgeSec into automation, orchestration, and AI-assisted detection logic.

## 🧱 Cyber Core

**Cyber Core** is the experimental core of ForgeSec — a modular environment purpose-built to explore, validate, and challenge defensive concepts through hands-on engineering.

It’s not about replicating corporate SOCs or testing isolated tools. Cyber Core is where cybersecurity becomes real: where theory is applied, assumptions are broken, and detection is studied from the ground up — packet by packet, decision by decision.

The environment evolves through structured learning, deep protocol analysis, adversarial simulation, and modular testing. Every experiment is crafted not to use a tool — but to understand the mechanisms behind visibility, detection, and response.

In this space, I validate:

- How detection pipelines behave under real traffic and edge cases  
- How systems interpret, normalize, and match patterns across protocols  
- How evasion works — and how it fails  
- How architectural decisions impact visibility, context, and accuracy  

Cyber Core is where I **build knowledge like an engineer** — with traffic, metrics, versioning, and documentation. It’s not a lab — it’s a framework to **think, experiment, and design defensively** with purpose.

## ⚔️ IGNITE

**IGNITE** is ForgeSec’s custom offensive module — an automation-focused tool designed to:

- Simulate real-world attacks and scans  
- Stress-test detection pipelines with crafted traffic  
- Serve as a learning and testing companion to Cyber Core

📂 See [`ignite/`](./ignite) for development roadmap and architecture.

## 📚 Learning Modules

Every test and feature in ForgeSec is built on solid theoretical foundations.  
Learning paths are documented like real engineering material: clean structure, no fluff, tested logic.

Current focus includes:

- IDS/IPS internals: from packet capture to alert generation  
- Signature design, flow tracking, decoding layers  
- Normalization, evasions, false positive reduction  
- Protocol awareness and metadata enrichment

📂 Learning modules are stored under: [`Cyber_Core/docs/`](./Cyber_Core/docs)

## 🧬 Philosophy

ForgeSec exists to embody a clear vision:

1. **Understand how detection really works**, not just how to configure tools  
2. **Write like a real team would** — clear, structured, reusable documentation  
3. **Learn by building** — each concept is tested in isolation and integrated in full-stack simulations  

This is not a demo lab. It’s an engineering sandbox where cybersecurity is treated as a serious design discipline — and documented like one.

> What I don’t understand, I build. What I build, I test. What I test, I document.
