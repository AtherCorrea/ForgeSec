# üõ°Ô∏è Cyber Core ‚Äî Defensive Simulation Environment

**Cyber Core** is an evolving cybersecurity engineering project focused on simulating and deeply understanding the core components of modern defensive environments.

This is not a repository of tutorials. It is a living, modular, and realistic simulation platform that replicates how real-world SOCs operate ‚Äî across detection, analysis, threat simulation, infrastructure, and eventually, automation and AI integration.

> üß† This project is built to serve as both a personal learning framework and a public technical portfolio ‚Äî documented clearly, tested rigorously, and designed for continuous expansion.  
> I'm also learning how to communicate complex systems effectively, so this environment serves to develop both my technical and documentation skills ‚Äî key abilities for real-world engineering teams.

## Why This Platform Exists

What if you could design and simulate your own cybersecurity environment ‚Äî and learn how everything really works under pressure, from the network up?

**Cyber Core** explores that question by combining:

- üß± Modular infrastructure and traffic visibility  
- üîç Deep technical analysis of detection pipelines and protocols  
- üß™ Real-world testing scenarios and adversarial simulation  
- üß† Theoretical foundation for every practical choice  
- üöÄ A roadmap toward integrating orchestration, automation, and AI

The goal is to build a space where cybersecurity is not just practiced, but truly understood.

## Project Philosophy

This environment reflects my belief that great security engineers are not built by reading tools‚Äô manuals ‚Äî they‚Äôre formed by understanding how systems behave, fail, and evolve.

It also reflects my personal ambition: to become a well-rounded cybersecurity engineer capable of not only solving technical problems, but documenting, explaining, and scaling those solutions.

That‚Äôs why every component of this project is written to simulate not just a SOC ‚Äî but also how real engineers think, test, and communicate.

## Learning Journey

The documentation follows a structured, layered path that maps to how real defenders build understanding. It starts with foundational concepts, then drills into engine internals, and finally tests everything in controlled technical conditions.

Topics include:

- Network-based threat detection theory  
- Intrusion detection vs prevention  
- Engine pipelines and multi-stage packet inspection  
- Detection models, evasion challenges, and flow/session logic  
- The role of normalization, decoding, and metadata in defensive accuracy

üìÇ All learning modules are organized in: [`docs/learning`](../docs/learning)

---

## Simulations & Detection Testing

This is not just theory. The environment includes practical testing where each concept is validated in real scenarios using:

- Controlled virtual machines (attacker and defender)  
- Structured rule validation and behavior mapping  
- Simulated attacks, probes, scans, and traffic artifacts

üìÇ All detection experiments are documented in: [`lab/`](../lab)

The simulation infrastructure is used to validate ideas, break assumptions, and learn through structured experimentation.

## Architecture and Growth

The current platform runs on VMware Workstation Pro 17 and includes:

- Firewalls (pfSense)  
- Suricata IDS/IPS  
- Linux and Windows-based machines  
- Simulated attack targets

> But this is just the beginning. **Cyber Core** is alive ‚Äî continuously evolving to test new tools, architectures, and hypotheses.

Planned additions include:

- SIEM platforms (Wazuh, Splunk)  
- Log correlation and threat intel ingestion  
- Evasion testing, flow tracking, and packet crafting  
- Experimentation with AI-driven detection logic

---

## Focus and Vision

This project is not about becoming a tool operator. It‚Äôs about becoming a cybersecurity engineer who understands how secure environments are designed, tested, broken, and rebuilt.

That includes:

- Designing layered network defenses  
- Understanding how detection engines process traffic  
- Building visibility and detection across multiple layers  
- Creating real-world test conditions to simulate attackers  
- Documenting the entire learning process with engineering clarity

**Cyber Core** is a personal and professional space for deep exploration of modern defense ‚Äî blending theory, experimentation, and communication into a complete engineering workflow.

## Roadmap Summary

- ‚úÖ Learning modules up to 2.2 completed (engine and packet pipeline)  
- ‚úÖ Initial detection tests conducted with Suricata and simulated traffic  
- üîÑ Expanding into flow tracking, decoding and advanced logging  
- üß† Planning SIEM and response layer integration  
- ü§ñ Future vision: AI analysis of logs, triage assistants, and adaptive detection
