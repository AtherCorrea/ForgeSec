# 🧠 IDS/IPS – Detection Systems

This folder groups all the IDS/IPS components and learning paths used in the Ather SOC Homelab. Each subfolder is dedicated to a specific engine or detection tool.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems are central to network defense. This directory explores how different engines work, how they’re configured, and how we can test and analyze their behavior in a lab setting.
