# 🧠 Learning Paths – SOC Homelab

This folder serves as the central hub for structured learning within the Ather SOC Homelab project.

> Rather than just using tools, the goal here is to deeply understand how each technology works — from theory to real-world application.

Each subfolder focuses on one major category (e.g., IDS/IPS) and contains:

- 📌 **Topic-Specific Roadmaps**  
  Clear and structured learning plans for each tool or concept

- 📘 **Theoretical Foundations**  
  Core cybersecurity concepts explained in depth

- ⚙️ **Architecture and Internals**  
  How each component actually works behind the scenes

- 🔬 **Lab-Based Testing and Analysis**  
  Practical experiments with real tools, captured logs, and result breakdowns

## 📁 Current Learning Modules

- `IPS_IDS/` – Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems  
  Deep dive into IDS/IPS theory, Suricata architecture, rule behavior, packet inspection, and lab validations.

More modules (e.g., SIEM, Packet Analysis, Threat Hunting) will be added as the lab expands.
