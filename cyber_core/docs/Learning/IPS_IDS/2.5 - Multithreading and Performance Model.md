### What Is It?

Modern IDS/IPS engines process massive volumes of traffic in real time. To scale effectively, they use **multithreading models** that split workload across CPU cores.

In Suricata, the threading model can be selected via configuration and dramatically impacts performance and behavior.

Main threading modes:

- `autofp` â€“ Auto Flow Pinning: Detection threads are assigned per flow
- `workers` â€“ One thread per capture stream (minimal internal queuing)
- `pcap` â€“ Used for offline `.pcap` file analysis

Each thread is responsible for part of the pipeline (e.g., capture, decode, detect, output), and these can run in parallel.

Performance tuning involves:

- `detect-thread-ratio`: How many detection threads per capture thread
- Buffer sizing: ring buffers, capture queues, stream reassembly buffers
- Timeout tuning: session, flow, and defrag timeouts
- CPU affinity: pinning threads to specific cores

### Why This Matters

Without proper threading, packet processing can become a bottleneck â€” leading to packet drops, detection delays, and missed alerts.

Multithreading enables:

- **Parallel processing** of multiple flows
- **Predictable performance** under high load
- **Determinism** in alert generation and timing

> In inline mode, threading misconfiguration can impact latency or block legitimate traffic.

Advanced setups may isolate roles:

- Core 0 â†’ Capture only
- Core 1â€“3 â†’ Detection threads
- Core 4 â†’ Logging/output

This separation increases stability and reduces contention.

### Practical Example

In Suricata's `suricata.yaml`, you can define:

```yaml
threading:
  set-cpu-affinity: yes
  cpu-affinity:
    - management-cpu-set:
        cpu: [0]
        mode: "exclusive"
        prio: 5
    - detect-cpu-set:
        cpu: [1, 2, 3]
        mode: "exclusive"
        prio: 5
  detect-thread-ratio: 3.0
```

This configuration:

- Binds the management thread to CPU 0
- Binds detection threads to CPUs 1â€“3
- Ensures 3 detection threads per capture thread

This boosts performance in high-throughput scenarios.
