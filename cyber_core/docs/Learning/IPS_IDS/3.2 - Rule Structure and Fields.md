## What Is It?

A detection rule is a structured, logic-driven statement that defines what the IDS/IPS engine should inspect, how it should interpret traffic, and when it should raise an alert.

It’s not just a “pattern search.” It’s a **declaration of intent** — a mini detection engine living inside a larger architecture.

Each rule is composed of **two main layers**:

1. **The Header**: Specifies *where* and *how* the rule applies (protocol, direction, source/destination).
2. **The Body (Options)**: Defines *what* to look for, *how* to find it, and *how* to classify it.

When well-written, a rule becomes an intelligent, surgical tool — reducing noise, detecting with precision, and integrating seamlessly with forensic and triage workflows.

---

## Why This Matters

Too many defenders treat rules as voodoo: copy-paste blobs with unclear logic.

ForgeSec’s philosophy is different. **You own every byte**. If a rule fires, you should know:

- What it looked for
- Why it fired
- Where in the traffic it matched
- What it tells you about the attack

Understanding the **structure** of a rule is the foundation for writing, debugging, and optimizing detection logic with confidence.

## Practical Example – Rule Breakdown

Let’s look at a complete ForgeSec-style rule and break down **every part of it** with depth.

```suricata
alert http any any -> any any (
  msg:"ForgeSec – Suspicious Admin Panel Access (Unauthenticated)";
  flow:to_server, established;
  content:"/admin";
  http_uri;
  depth:60;
  classtype:attempted-admin;
  priority:2;
  sid:2001001;
  rev:3;
)
```

---

### 🔹 Rule Header: `alert http any any -> any any`

This is the **execution context**. It tells the engine:

- `alert`: This is a rule that will trigger an alert.
- `http`: The protocol decoder required (Suricata decodes HTTP over TCP).
- `any any`: Source IP and port (`any` means all).
- `->`: Directional operator. We're inspecting traffic *from source to destination*.
- `any any`: Destination IP and port.

In practice, this says:  
**"For any HTTP traffic going to any destination, apply the logic below."**

> In a real deployment, you may scope this down (e.g., internal IP ranges, specific ports).

---

### 🔸 `msg:"ForgeSec – Suspicious Admin Panel Access (Unauthenticated)"`

This is the **human-readable message** that appears in logs when this rule fires. It should:

- Clearly describe the condition being detected.
- Include context (e.g., “unauthenticated” access attempt).
- Use a naming convention (`ForgeSec –`) for attribution and filtering.

Strong `msg` fields speed up triage and provide instant clarity in alerts.

---

### 🔸 `flow:to_server, established;`

The `flow` keyword controls **session context**. It restricts the rule to packets that:

- Are part of a fully established connection (i.e., completed TCP handshake).
- Are going **to the server** (from client to service endpoint).

This avoids triggering on:

- Scanning or connection attempts (not yet established).
- Server responses (wrong direction).
- Random packets in incomplete flows.

Use `flow` to **control scope and reduce noise**.

---

### 🔸 `content:"/admin";`

This is the core **pattern matcher**. It looks for the ASCII string `/admin` in the decoded payload.

By itself, `content` matches anywhere — but it becomes *powerful* when paired with context:

- Protocol keyword (e.g., `http_uri`)
- Direction (`flow`)
- Payload window (`depth`, `offset`)

Multiple `content` clauses can be chained to build complex detections.

---

### 🔸 `http_uri;`

This anchors the previous `content` search to a specific protocol field — the URI part of an HTTP request.

Instead of scanning the full payload blindly, this says:

> “Only match `/admin` if it appears in the HTTP URI.”

This adds **semantic precision** and reduces false positives.

---

### 🔸 `depth:60;`

This restricts how much of the payload is inspected — in this case, only the first 60 bytes.

Why?

- Performance: Faster matching by reducing scope.
- Precision: Prevents matching patterns buried deep in the payload (e.g., POST bodies).

If `/admin` appears after byte 60, it won’t match — and that’s intentional. Adjust based on expected payload structure.

---

### 🔸 `classtype:attempted-admin;`

This categorizes the alert logically. It doesn’t change detection, but it helps:

- Group alerts by type in SIEMs.
- Prioritize based on class (e.g., `trojan-activity` vs `misc-activity`).
- Feed correlation engines with thematic indicators.

ForgeSec recommends using well-defined, consistent `classtype` values across your ruleset.

---

### 🔸 `priority:2;`

This is the **urgency level**, used to prioritize alerts.

- `1`: Critical (RCE, C2 beacon)
- `2`: High (Credential access, sensitive endpoint interaction)
- `3`: Medium (Scans, probes)
- `4–5`: Low/Info

Use this to control:

- Alert escalation thresholds
- Email/Slack/response triggers
- Filtering in dashboards

> A low-priority rule firing 100 times may still be less important than one priority-1 alert.

---

### 🔸 `sid:2001001;`

This is the **Signature ID** — a unique identifier for the rule. It must:

- Be consistent across revisions.
- Never be reused.
- Be globally unique in your rulebase.

ForgeSec uses the `2001XXX` range for custom rules. You can group rules by project, module, or attack class using ranges.

This ID is how:

- SIEMs track events.
- Analysts suppress or whitelist alerts.
- Scripts tune or enable/disable rules.

---

### 🔸 `rev:3;`

This is the rule's **revision version**. Every time the rule changes — even slightly — you should increment `rev`.

Why?

- To track evolution of logic.
- To invalidate stale tuning decisions.
- To maintain auditability across updates.

A rule without version control is a **blind spot** in your detection posture.
