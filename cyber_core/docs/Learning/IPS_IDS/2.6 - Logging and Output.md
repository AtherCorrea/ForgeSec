### What Is It?

Once detection has occurred, the IDS/IPS must generate **structured, actionable output**. This is the responsibility of the **logging and output subsystem**, which formats events, enriches them with metadata, and exports them for triage, alerting, or correlation.

In Suricata, this is handled primarily via:

- `eve.json`: JSON-based structured log (default format)
- `fast.log`: flat alert log (quick and human-readable)
- `stats.log`: performance counters and engine metrics
- `files-json`, `http-log`, `tls-log`: protocol-specific output

Logging is configurable, modular, and can include:

- **Alert events** (rule matches)
- **Flow records** (start, end, duration, bytes)
- **Protocol metadata** (DNS queries, HTTP URIs, TLS SNI)
- **Packet payloads and hashes** (optional, for forensic purposes)

---

### Why This Matters

Detection without logging is meaningless â€” the value of an IDS/IPS depends on **what it records and how it can be consumed**.

Suricataâ€™s flexible output formats allow integration with:

- SIEMs (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk)
- Log shippers (e.g., Filebeat, syslog)
- Correlation engines or alert pipelines

Accurate logs:

- Enable triage, investigation, and response
- Provide context for detected threats
- Can be stored, replayed, or audited

Misconfigured or noisy logging can flood analysts, waste disk space, or miss key signals.

### Practical Example

An HTTP request triggers an alert:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-30T22:48:00.133Z",
  "flow_id": 2173923432901240,
  "in_iface": "em0",
  "event_type": "alert",
  "src_ip": "192.168.100.10",
  "dest_ip": "203.0.113.10",
  "proto": "TCP",
  "alert": {
    "signature_id": 1000021,
    "signature": "Malicious URI Access",
    "category": "Ather Custom",
    "severity": 2
  },
  "http": {
    "hostname": "malicious.example",
    "url": "/exploit-kit",
    "http_user_agent": "curl/7.85.0",
    "http_method": "GET",
    "protocol": "HTTP/1.1"
  }
}
```

This JSON alert contains:

- Core metadata (IP, interface, protocol)
- Detection info (SID, message, severity)
- Application metadata (URI, method, user-agent)

This structure can be filtered, enriched, and indexed by log pipelines.

> âœ… Logging is not just output â€” it's the **interface between detection and action**. Structured logs allow Suricata to feed modern security workflows with high-fidelity, machine-readable data.
