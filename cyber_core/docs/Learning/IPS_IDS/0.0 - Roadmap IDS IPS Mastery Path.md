This document outlines a structured learning journey to deeply understand Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), using hands-on experiments, log analysis, and real-world tools like Suricata and pfSense.

> The goal is not simply to *use* IDS/IPS tools — but to fully understand **how** they work, **why** they matter, and **what happens internally** when malicious traffic is detected or blocked. This is part of a broader initiative to master cybersecurity through real lab work.

## 📚 Learning Stages

### 1.Fundamentals (Theory)

Understand the foundational concepts:

- What are IDS and IPS?
- IDS vs IPS vs Firewalls – core differences
- Inline vs Passive deployment
- Detection techniques: Signature-based vs Anomaly-based

📄 Documentation: [`1.0 - IPS-IDS Fundamentals – Theoretical Concepts`](1.0%20-%20IPS%20IDS%20Fundamentals%20Theoretical%20Concepts.md)

---

### 2. How IDS/IPS Engines Work

Understand the internal architecture of IDS/IPS solutions:

- Traffic capture and preprocessing stages
- Flow/session tracking and inspection
- How detection pipelines evaluate packets
- Multithreading, performance tuning, and log outputs
- Differences in passive (IDS) vs inline (IPS) modes

📄 Documentation: [`2.0 - How IDS/IPS Engines Work`](2.0%20-%20How%20IDS_IPS%20Engines%20Work.md)

- 📄 [`2.1 - Packet Capture and Ingestion`](2.1%20-%20Packet%20Capture%20and%20Ingestion.md)
- 📄 [`2.2 - Decoding and Normalization`](2.2%20-%20Decoding%20and%20Normalization.md)

---

### 3. Rule Behavior & Signature Analysis

Explore how rules actually work:

- Rule structure: `msg`, `sid`, `classtype`, `priority`, etc.
- Rule matching engine and order of evaluation
- Custom rule creation and testing
- How Suricata prioritizes alerts
- Identifying and tuning false positives

---

### 4. Detection Testing in Lab

Simulate real attacks and verify detection:

- Attack simulations (Nmap scans, Metasploit payloads, brute force, etc.)
- Triggering IDS alerts with known test signatures
- Analyzing results in Suricata logs
- Cleaning logs between tests for reproducibility

---

### 5. SIEM Integration (Post IDS)

Expand visibility by forwarding Suricata data:

- Shipping Suricata logs to SIEM (Wazuh/Splunk)
- Parsing and enrichment for correlation
- Combining IDS with firewall and endpoint telemetry
- Visualizing timeline, severity, and frequency

---

### 6. Advanced Topics & Optimization

Refine and expand your IDS/IPS knowledge:

- Performance tuning and hardware optimization
- Detection evasion techniques and countermeasures
- Threat Intelligence integration with Suricata
- Automated rule management (PulledPork, Oinkmaster)
- IPS mode configuration and packet drop verification
