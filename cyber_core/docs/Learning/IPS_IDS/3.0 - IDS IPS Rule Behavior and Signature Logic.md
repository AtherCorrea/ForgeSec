This document introduces the behavior, logic, and performance considerations of IDS/IPS detection rules. It serves as a foundational part of the ForgeSec detection strategy, focusing on conceptual understanding rather than tool-specific syntax.

Each section in this chapter is designed to explore a different aspect of rule logic â€” from basic structure to engineering custom detections â€” building toward mastery in designing high-fidelity, high-performance alert logic.

## 3.1 What Is a Detection Rule?

Conceptual introduction to what constitutes a detection rule in an IDS/IPS context. Not tool-specific. Emphasizes rules as logical constructs representing intent, behavior, or threat detection patterns.

## 3.2 Rule Structure and Fields

Breakdown of core rule components:

- Header fields: `msg`, `sid`, `rev`, `classtype`, `priority`
- Match conditions: `content`, `flow`, `http_method`, `depth`, `offset`
- Logical operators: AND, OR, NOT
- Syntax and semantic roles in rule evaluation

## 3.3 Rule Matching Pipeline

Covers how detection engines process and evaluate rules:

- Parsing and compilation
- Optimization phases
- Matching flow (pattern tree â†’ conditions â†’ full match)
- Rule order and execution strategy

## 3.4 Rule Types and Strategies

Explores types of rules and their use cases:

- Simple content-based rules
- Compound rules with multiple match conditions
- Stateful and directional rules (e.g., `flow:to_client`)
- Context-aware rules (metadata, app-layer fields)

## 3.5 False Positives and Rule Tuning

Strategies to reduce alert noise and improve detection quality:

- Common causes of false positives
- Rule tuning via `flowbits`, `threshold`, `detection_filter`, etc.
- Avoiding overfitting and alert blindness

## 3.6 Custom Rule Engineering

Designing original detection logic:

- Creating rules without relying on vendor feeds
- Behavior-based rule writing
- Validation strategies using crafted pcaps and Cyber Core integration

## 3.7 Rule Performance Considerations

Operational impact of detection logic:

- Detecting and mitigating expensive rules
- Grouping and modularization strategies
- Measuring rule cost and optimizing throughput

## 3.8 Why This Matters

The strategic value of mastering detection rule behavior:

- Enhancing detection fidelity
- Enabling intelligent tuning and SIEM integration
- Building automated triage and hunting pipelines
- Asserting control over the detection surface
