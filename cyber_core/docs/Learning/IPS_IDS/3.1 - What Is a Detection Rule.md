## What Is It?

A **detection rule** in an IDS/IPS context is a logical expression that describes how to identify specific traffic patterns or behaviors that may indicate malicious or suspicious activity.

It is not tied to any single tool or syntax — but instead represents a concept: **codifying detection logic** based on observable network artifacts.

Rules are evaluated against decoded, enriched traffic and can express conditions across:

- Protocol layers (from TCP to HTTP/TLS/DNS)
- Flow direction and session state
- Specific payload contents or metadata
- Behavioral indicators like timing or volume

> A detection rule is more than a pattern match — it's an *assertion of defensive intent*.

## Why This Matters

Without a clear understanding of what a detection rule actually is, engineers fall into two traps:

1. Treating rules as vendor black-boxes.
2. Writing rules that work syntactically, but fail semantically.

By treating rules as **intentional constructs**, you unlock the ability to:

- Create **high-fidelity alerts** aligned to your threat model.
- Tune and adapt detection as environments change.
- Transition from consumer to **author of security intelligence**.

> The power of IDS/IPS lies not in the engine — but in the logic it executes. Rules **are** that logic.

## Practical Example

Consider the difference between these two rule mindsets:

❌ **Tool-centric (shallow)**  
> “I copied this rule from the community feed. It alerts on port 8080 traffic.”

✅ **Logic-centric (ForgeSec)**  
> “I crafted a rule that detects unexpected HTTP POSTs to admin interfaces over uncommon ports, with rare user-agents and no referrer — a likely sign of enumeration or exploit staging.”

The second reflects a detection rule built with **intent, context, and logic** — not just syntax.
