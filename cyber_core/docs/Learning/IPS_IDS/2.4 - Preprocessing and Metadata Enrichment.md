### What Is It?

After packet decoding and flow tracking, the IDS/IPS engine applies **preprocessors** to enrich traffic with semantic metadata. This step is where the engine understands **which application protocol is in use**, extracts meaningful fields from it, and prepares data for detection.

Key actions:

- **Application protocol identification** (HTTP, TLS, DNS, etc.)
- **Field extraction** (e.g., `http.method`, `tls.sni`, `dns.qry.name`)
- **Metadata tagging** (e.g., `flow_id`, `app_proto`, `stream_id`, `tls.version`)
- **Normalization of application-layer data** (e.g., case folding, field stripping)

The output of this step is a flow/session annotated with structured metadata â€” which detection rules can use with precision.

### Why This Matters

Raw payload inspection is insufficient when dealing with modern, encrypted, or complex traffic. Preprocessors enable detection to operate at a **semantic level**.

Examples of what would be impossible without this stage:

- Detecting SNI fields in TLS without decrypting the session
- Matching HTTP `User-Agent` headers
- Blocking DNS queries based on domain patterns

This also feeds the logging engine with structured data (e.g., `eve.json`), used for correlation, hunting, and triage.

> Detection becomes **protocol-aware and context-driven**, not just pattern-matching bytes in isolation.

### Practical Example

Suricata observes an outbound TLS connection with the following characteristics:

- Destination IP: `203.0.113.10`
- TLS version: `1.0`
- SNI: `malware.c2-domain.xyz`

The engine performs:

1. Protocol detection â†’ `tls`
2. Field extraction â†’ parses `tls.version`, `tls.sni`
3. Metadata generation â†’ assigns `flow_id`, `app_proto: tls`
4. Prepares metadata for rules and logs

Detection rule:

```suricata
alert tls any any -> any any (
    msg:"Suspicious TLS SNI";
    tls.sni; content:"c2-domain";
    tls.version:1.0;
    sid:1000012;
)
```

This rule would only be possible after enrichment â€” the raw packet doesn't expose these fields directly.

> âœ… Preprocessing is where traffic stops being raw bytes and becomes **semantically meaningful metadata**. Without this layer, modern detection logic would be blind to application behavior.
