### What Is It?

**Flow tracking** is the process of grouping packets that belong to the same communication session based on their **5-tuple**:

- Source IP
- Destination IP
- Source Port
- Destination Port
- Protocol

An IDS/IPS engine like Suricata uses this to reconstruct **bidirectional sessions** between two endpoints.

The flow module:

- Maintains state across packets (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
- Tracks session lifecycle (e.g., TCP SYN â†’ SYN/ACK â†’ FIN)
- Stores metadata like flow age, byte count, packet count, and protocol state
- Enables rule matching with flow context (e.g., `flow:to_server, established;`)

---

### Why This Matters

Without flow tracking, the engine would inspect packets in isolation â€” unable to:

- Detect multi-packet attacks
- Understand directionality (client vs server)
- Apply stateful logic (e.g., only alert on established connections)
- Reassemble full conversations for higher-layer protocol analysis (e.g., HTTP, TLS)

Flow tracking enables more accurate detection by preserving **context over time**.

> Many detection rules rely on flow state (e.g., `established`, `to_server`) to avoid false positives and optimize performance.

It also enables efficient use of memory and resources, as inactive flows can be expired after a timeout, and noisy stateless traffic can be ignored if out of context.

### Practical Example

Imagine the following TCP session:

1. Client (10.0.0.10:40000) â†’ Server (10.0.0.1:80): `SYN`
2. Server â†’ Client: `SYN-ACK`
3. Client â†’ Server: `ACK`
4. Client â†’ Server: `GET /index.html`

Suricata:

- Identifies the 5-tuple as a unique flow
- Tracks its TCP state (handshake complete)
- Marks direction: client â†’ server
- Allows HTTP parser to activate for this flow
- Allows a rule like:

```suricata
alert http any any -> any any (msg:"Detect HTTP GET"; flow:to_server, established; content:"GET "; http_method; sid:1000005;)
```

This rule only fires if:

- The packet is part of a tracked flow
- The flow is established
- The direction is correct
- The HTTP parser confirms it's a GET request

Without flow tracking, this logic would be impossible.

> âœ… Flow tracking is a foundational capability that transforms packet inspection into **session-aware detection**, enabling richer analysis, fewer false positives, and deeper protocol inspection.
