# ðŸ”¥ pfSense â€“ Firewall Configuration

This directory holds all configuration files, behavior tests, and documentation related to **pfSense**, the primary firewall in the SOC lab. pfSense is used to enforce network segmentation, control traffic between interfaces, and serve as the integration point for IDS/IPS functionality (Suricata).

By deploying pfSense in the lab, we simulate a real corporate perimeter and internal firewall setup.

## ðŸ“¦ Contents

- [`config/`](./config/) â€“ Exported configuration files and interface setup
- [`tests/`](./tests/) â€“ Connection tests, ICMP rules, NAT behavior, and more

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Deploy a fully functional virtual firewall in the lab environment
- Control and isolate traffic using NAT and interface rules
- Provide a stable base for IDS/IPS integration and SIEM data ingestion
- Study how firewalls behave under scan, stress, and misconfiguration

## ðŸ§ª Example Test Case

```
test-icmp-blocked/
â”œâ”€â”€ description.md         # Problem and solution
â”œâ”€â”€ screenshot.png         # Rule configuration
â””â”€â”€ notes.md               # Observations and impact
```

Each test is tracked to show real network behavior and its impact on visibility and control.
